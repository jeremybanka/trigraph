## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- dc18f81: Use `create-design` to scaffold workspaces and add projects, and move existing-project operations to the new `design` CLI with `build`, `check`, `dev`, `serve`, and `export` commands.

### Patch Changes

- 3275452: Add editable point and area text, canonical font shaping and outline projection,
  persistent source fonts, PDF text lowering, overset diagnostics, and undoable
  text expansion. Use ready browser faces in the native editing overlay and exact
  layout/ink bounds for text selection, transforms, whitespace hit testing, and
  dragging. Rehydrate installed font bytes before reload preflight, reject stale
  browser font loads, and let whitespace double-clicks enter text editing.
  Keep canonical glyph outlines visually authoritative while the accessible native
  surface owns caret, selection, composition, and input. Store authored text in
  stable adjacent raw UTF-8 `.txt` units with lossless inline-source migration and
  coherent source/version-control transactions.
  Absorb proportional Point and Area Text resizing into canonical typography and
  frame metrics, including mixed selections and repeated transforms, while
  preserving anchored world geometry. Keep the native editor's content width
  independent of its border and prevent Point Text from soft-wrapping so caret and
  selection insertion boundaries remain aligned with shaped glyph advances.

  Keep installed font inventories and binary files coherent across comparison and
  selective version-control commits.
- 1a9b87b: Add authored layer UI colors, layer-colored selection outlines and fills, and a neutral layer-agnostic selection marquee.
- 350ae8c: Give the Create Art CLI servers distinctive default ports and shut down CLI and repository development process trees cleanly on Ctrl-C.
- 6421beb: Add placed raster images and editable clipping masks across source projects, canvas rendering, and PDF/SVG export.
- 48db2a7: Add a canonical create-design logo and demonstrate portable live artboard links by placing it in the Workbench Poster sample. Make live links discoverable in the Layers and Object tiles, treat their artboard bounds as a single snapping object, and carry placement scale into stroke widths and dash metrics.
- 8a6aee9: Add deterministic PNG export, browser worker downloads and live preview, and CLI batch parity.
- 2bc8b32: Import Adobe Illustrator's native revisable source into a shared canvas
  hierarchy with original artboards, layers, vector paint, clipping, compound
  paths, and live text instead of treating embedded PDF preview pages as artwork.
- 6376ef1: Finish first-class layers with hierarchy reparenting, stable source synchronization, semantic review, and a representative multi-layer fixture.
- 5c9197e: Preserve linked artboard paints, artboard backgrounds, live text and image resources, clipping, visibility and locking, and atomic selection across canvas and headless PDF, SVG, and PNG exports, with explicit diagnostics for unresolved and cyclic references.
- bbf22f4: Add workspace design switching and versioned portable live linked-artboard objects, including browser canvas/export projection and isolated recovery state.
- 653eb46: Persist versioned named UI layouts from grouped home and project ui.json sources through the tile-management HUD in create-font and create-design, including supported locations reached through filesystem symlinks.
- 17f9651: Add deterministic SVG import, artboard export, browser download and live preview, and CLI parity with structured unsupported-content diagnostics.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a5c4e14: Replace the singleton page with ordered named artboards and deterministic legacy migrations.

### Patch Changes

- 8af2cfe: Add deterministic alignment, distribution, and inspector-backed numeric selection transforms.
- 7205533: Keep create-design rulers clear of tile lanes and theme the canvas for system appearance.
- 7471aca: Add hierarchy-safe Pathfinder Divide, Trim, Merge, Crop, and Outline commands
  with off-thread progress, cancellation, and stale-result protection.
- 8188be2: Separate the create-design browser editor from its CLI and server package,
  move shared editor foundations under create-art ownership, and make font-owned
  package directories explicit throughout the workspace. Move the product-neutral
  Preact Konva bindings into the product-neutral `@create-art` scope. Put
  canonical document initialization in the source package and extract headless
  design-model and PDF packages for browser and CLI consumers. Keep the
  fea-rs-wasm build and benchmark scripts runnable from their scoped directory.
- 93afa43: Author optional fill and stroke paints from one accessible Appearance tile, including none, swap, mixed selections, and new-object defaults.
- 7390b70: Add shared tile control primitives and split create-design's Object, Transform,
  and Arrange inspectors into focused tiles. Keep their control layouts stable
  across selection states, use disabled controls for unavailable actions, and use
  a single pressed-button treatment for constrained proportions.
- 8ed890a: Add deterministic Pathfinder Intersect and Exclude operations.
- c852f02: Declare the repository's MPL library boundary and AGPL application boundary, with explicit permissions for generated assets.
- 16e86cb: Add persistent rulers and guides with configurable multi-source smart snapping.
- 151d54a: Expand visible strokes into deterministic compact cubic fill contours with complete cap, join, miter, dash, transform, and atomic undo support.
- 3cbad6c: Add deterministic Pathfinder Unite and Subtract Front over editable filled regions.

- 306063e: Add strict versioned design-document decoding and deterministic v1-to-v2 migration.
- 932b362: Add deterministic shared export preflight diagnostics, blocking only unsupported output while keeping warnings and opt-in advisories non-blocking.
- ad3427b: Export ordered artboard scopes as deterministic clipped multi-page PDFs with bleed and generation-safe preview/downloads.
- 7471aca: Add hierarchy-safe groups, compound paths with authored fill rules, and atomic stacking commands.
- dd3321b: Add persistent nested artwork groups with atomic selection, movement, duplication,
  group, ungroup, and stacking commands plus explicit group-content drill-down.
  Shared vector contours now expose the renderer's existing double-click and
  double-tap activation events for group drill-down.
- 08c4074: Refine the create-design shell with source-aware navigation, consolidated canvas status, contextual help, and accessible live announcements.
- 41e85b8: Establish global document coordinates and stable vector identities.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 0d59cb3: Format canonical create-font and create-design source with the pinned,
  published dprint contract before hashing and persistence, and expose matching
  `create-source-format` fmt/check workflows for users, editors, and CI.
- 05f8226: Transfer byte-preserved design assets through bounded, atomic source RPC transactions.
- 07d8245: Preserve editable live rectangles and ellipses with exact parameters and atomic path expansion.
- 05f8226: Generalize bounded source comparison and selective Git commits with adapter-defined semantic change groups, and enable design-aware version control.
- f311815: Add explicit persistence, conflict, invalid-source, and crash-recovery workflows with accessible controls.
- 76d6aa0: Add shared revisioned source RPC infrastructure and source-backed create-design workspaces with atomic persistence and reliable live editor synchronization, including active glyph restoration after external filesystem resets. Run both editors and their APIs from the root development command on a configurable four-port block, with the checked-in Workbench Poster as create-design's default development source.
- 0bdcb56: Separate authored geometry, object transforms, and optional fill/stroke appearance while preserving legacy path objects.
- 4b938c1: Add a deterministic directory-shaped create-design source codec with indexed document, palette, artboard, layer, object, asset, and font boundaries.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- f8badaf: Compile PDFs incrementally and add an opt-in live PDF proof with stale-result protection.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 38e7d82: Share Konva canvas foundations and move the create-design canvas to Konva.
- e354211: Add shared font and design vector adapters with a neutral clipboard interchange boundary. Complete create-design Pen authoring with hard and smooth nodes, live Bézier handles, open and closed contour finalization, atomic undo and redo, and persisted vector objects. Defer the create-design Rule tool until it has a complete design-specific interaction.
- 13eda7d: Add shared authoritative vector gesture state machines and interactive scene components for font and design editing, including complete Pen drafts, Bézier handles, cancellation, shape placement, selection, and coordinate-correct transforms in both y-up and y-down canvases. Keep create-design persistence and history in its document adapter while deferring its Rule tool, and preserve create-font's responsive native Pen transactions and unselected preview marker. Add an issue-linked create-font tool itinerary, mounted interaction-lifecycle regressions, and CI-enforced Vitest coverage floors for the font-tool surface. Keep Pen commits responsive by using shallow revision dependencies for mounted font projections, compiling live fonts only while a Preview tile is present, coalescing whole-source persistence after an edit burst, and moving post-save full-font validation into an incremental source worker so edits do not block the renderer. Restore Shift-marquee selection inversion so every covered node or handle toggles its prior selection state, fully select pasted contours including their authored handles, and keep selected-contour fills, outlines, nodes, and screen-constant selection rings aligned with the pointer while controlled Konva nodes rerender. Let the full-width invisible edge hit target initiate the same selected-contour drag as the visible stroke.
- 216946d: Let applications provide tile registries so font and design editors share workspace tiling behavior, and migrate create-design's complete tool and inspector UI into managed tiles.
